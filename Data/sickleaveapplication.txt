Subject: Sick Leave Application

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and will not be able to come to work for the next few days. I request you to kindly grant me sick leave for the same.

I woke up this morning with a high fever and severe body ache. I consulted a doctor who advised me to rest and take medication for the next few days. I am currently taking the prescribed medication and will make sure to take care of myself until I am fully recovered.

I request you to kindly grant me leave for the next three days, i.e., [starting date] to [ending date]. I will make sure to catch up on any pending work as soon as I return to work.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused due to my absence. I can be reached via email or phone during my leave if there is any urgent work that needs my attention.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Sujal Bhosale
